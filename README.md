 # 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The goal is to divide a company's customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or other attributes, enabling targeted marketing and personalized strategies.

🧐 Project Overview

Customer segmentation helps businesses to better understand their customers and tailor products or marketing campaigns according to each segment's characteristics. This project uses the K-Means Clustering algorithm to analyze customer data, group similar customers together, and visualize the results.

In this project:

We load customer data (e.g., age, income, spending score).
Preprocess the data to handle missing values, standardize the features, and remove any outliers.
Apply K-Means clustering to identify different customer segments.
Evaluate the model's performance using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
📈 Features and Insights

Clustering: The K-Means algorithm segments the customers into distinct groups based on similarities.
Elbow Method: Helps determine the optimal number of clusters (k).
Silhouette Score: Measures the quality of the clusters.
Visualization: Visualizes customer segments using 2D or 3D plots.
🧑‍💼 Dataset

The dataset typically includes attributes such as:

Age: The age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): The annual income of the customer (in thousands).
Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned based on customer spending habits (higher means more frequent spenders).
For this project, you can use datasets such as:

Mall Customer Segmentation Data
Customer Segmentation Dataset
Note: The dataset must contain customer-related attributes (e.g., age, income, and spending) for clustering.
🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:
Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Install dependencies:
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional) and install the required libraries using pip.
🚀 Usage

Prepare the Data:
Ensure your dataset is in CSV format with the necessary attributes like age, income, and spending score. The dataset should have columns for each customer’s attributes.
Preprocessing the Data:
Clean the data, handle missing values, and scale the features to standardize them for clustering.
Apply K-Means Clustering:
Train the K-Means model and determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Train the K-Means Model:
Based on the Elbow Method's results, select the optimal number of clusters and fit the K-Means model to the data.
Visualize the Clusters:
Visualize the resulting clusters on a 2D plot, such as plotting Annual Income vs. Spending Score.
🔍 Evaluation

Elbow Method: The optimal number of clusters is typically determined by the "elbow" point in the inertia graph (where the rate of decrease in inertia slows down).
Silhouette Score: Evaluates how well-separated the clusters are. A score close to 1 indicates well-separated clusters.
🧩 Future Work

Advanced Clustering: Experiment with different clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering.
Dimensionality Reduction: Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the number of features and visualize high-dimensional data.
Cluster Profiling: Analyze the demographic and behavioral characteristics of each customer segment.
📊 Results

After applying K-Means clustering, the model segments customers into distinct groups, which can then be analyzed to tailor marketing efforts. The clusters could correspond to different customer profiles, such as:

High-Income, Low-Spending
Young, Frequent Spenders
Middle-Aged, Budget-Conscious
